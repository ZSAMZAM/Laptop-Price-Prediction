# Laptop Price Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project predicts laptop prices based on hardware specifications such as
RAM, CPU, storage, and screen size using Multiple Linear Regression.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Laptop Price Dataset  
The dataset contains laptop specifications and their corresponding prices.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Data understanding and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and encoding
3. Model training using Multiple Linear Regression
4. Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score

## Results
The model shows that RAM, CPU, and storage have the strongest impact on laptop price.

## Future Work
- Use advanced models like Random Forest
- Add GPU specifications
- Deploy as a web application
